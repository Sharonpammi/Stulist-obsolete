    <h2><a id="description">Website Description:</a></h2>
        <p>
            This website is a place where college students can sell/trade various items (books, computers, clothing, etc) or
            services(tutoring, dance lessons, music lessons, etc.) with other college students. Proof of college status is
            required in order to make an account (.edu email). However, the search and browse feature isn’t only for users.
            Anyone will be able to search or browse the website; however, certain information will not be displayed unless
            logged into an account. User’s cannot directly buy items through the website, they have to collaborate with the seller
            and decide on the final price/meeting place for the transaction. Buyers and sellers will have a medium in which they
            can communicate with each other.
        </p>

    <h2><a id="accountCreation">Account Creation:</a></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Users can create an account by providing an .edu email address, full name, university name, account username,
                a password, and travel range. Necessary validation will be done (Ex: check if username exists, validate email, etc..)
            </li>
            <li>
                Once created and confirmed, the user can list items up for sale/trade as well as search/browse for items with
                the ability to see seller/price information. (Non account holders can’t see seller info or prices).
            </li>
        </ul>

    <h2><a id="listingProcess">Users can list items/services for sale/trade:</a></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                An account is necessary for this feature of the website.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once logged in, the user can click on a button that will guide him or her to the listing webpage.
            </li>
            <li>
                In order for the item/service to be listed, all necessary filters and specific information must be provided.
                User’s can’t omit certain filters because they will be needed when other users search for items.
            </li>
            <li>
                Use Case:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        User wants to sell a History textbook.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After arriving to the listing webpage, he or she has to select the category in which the item belongs
                        to (In our case: Textbooks).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Based on the category, users will be prompted to provide additional sub-categories. (In our case,
                        the sub category will be subjects: History)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        User category selection is completed, the user will be prompted with text boxes for various item
                        descriptions (Title, Author, ISBN, ISBN 13)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The user can then provide a brief description of the item, and must select the condition of the item
                        (New, Like New, Very Good, Good, Damaged, Broken, etc.)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Finally, the user can choose whether to list the item as sell and/or trade. If “sell” is selected,
                        the user must input the price at which the item will be sold for. If “trade” is selected, the user
                        can specify the price range of items that he or she is willing to trade for.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

    <h2><a id="searchingProcess">Users can search for certain items/services:</a></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The main search bar will only execute the user’s search once a category is selected.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The categories will be provided next to the search bar in the form of a drop down menu.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The user has to specify one of the two major categories (items or services)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Depending on which major category is selected, sub categories will be provided as additional filters.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This is also where the user can specify the rating limit on items, based on the ratings.
                        (Ex: only list items that are at or above 4 stars).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once a category is provided, depending on which is selected, additional text boxes/GUI properties
                        (check boxes, radio buttons, etc…) will appear for filtering appropriate results.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Use Case:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Let’s say a user wishes to search for textbooks. He or she will select the items category,
                        and select Textbooks.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once the category is selected, another drop down menu will appear, allowing the user to specify
                        the topic of their search (Title, Author, ISBN, ISBN 13, etc…)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once the search topic is selected, another drop down menu will appear, allowing the user to specify
                        the subject of interest (Math, History, Physics, Computer Science, etc…). It’s important to note,
                        this portion is optional. If the user wanted, he can press the search button and view results without
                        providing additional filters.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once submitted, the user will be provided with a list of all items that are in relevance to his or her search.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                The search feature is not limited to users who have accounts. Anyone will be able to search items. However,
                the price, individual item description page, and seller information  will require an account to be viewed.
            </li>
        </ul>

    <h2><a id="browsingProcess">Users can browsed by item/service categories:</a></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Users can select major categories to browse by (Computers, Textbooks, Clothing, Tutoring, etc...)
            </li>
            <li>
                Just like the search filter, user’s can select rating limits on items/services (Ex: Higher than 3.5 stars).
            </li>
            <li>
                Users will then be presented with a list of all items within that result.
            </li>
            <li>
                If needed, the user can refine these results by providing additional filters (items that range between
                certain prices, items that are only up for trade, Tshirts *if in the Clothing category*, etc...)
            </li>
            <li>
                Users can then click on any item/service and will be directed to the item/service description page.
            </li>
            <li>
                The browse feature is not limited to users who have accounts. Anyone will be able to search items. However,
                the price, individual item description page, and seller information  will require an account to be viewed.
            </li>
        </ul>

    <h2><a id="ratingSystem">Rating System:</a></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Based on the quality of a transaction, both buyers and sellers can rate each other.
            </li>
            <li>
                The review is based on five-star scale (higher is better).
            </li>
            <li>
                Users can select a rating in increments of .5 (0.5 being the lowest and 5.0 being the highest)
            </li>
            <li>
                A seller’s/buyer’s rating is calculated with the percentage of overall reviews. For example, a user has 5
                reviews in total. The score of each review is 3, 4.5, 3, 4, 2.5. The total score is 17. The percentage is 17/25 = 68%
            </li>
            <li>
                This information will be used as additional filtering options for when users search/browse for items.
            </li>
        </ul>

    <h2><a id="userCommunication">User-to-user communication:</a></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Once a buyer is interested in an item or service, he or she has to first be logged into an account.
                The buyer can then send the seller a notification with a brief message.
            </li>
            <li>
                The notification will appear in the inbox of the seller.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the seller wishes to sell the item to the buyer, he or she can send a message back, which will in turn
                appear in the buyer’s inbox.
            </li>
            <li>
                By default, the message will appear in the user’s account inbox. However, if the user gives permission to
                allow email notifications, the message will also be emailed to the user’s .edu email. (However, the user has to
                sign into the website to send a response. Replying to the email won’t be sent to the buyer/seller.)
            </li>
            <li>
                The seller and buyers will discuss and make the necessary meeting arrangements/final price.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once an item is sold/traded, the seller can remove his or item from being listed.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Listed items must be given a time frame as to how long they are to stay active. After the given time,
                        the listing will be automatically taken down regardless if the item hasn’t been sold/traded
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The maximum length of time listings may stay active is 14 days. If a seller posts a listing to stay
                        active for 14 days, sells the item earlier, he can either close the listing himself or let our system
                        take down the listing after 14 days has past.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

    <h2><a id="googleMapsApi">Google API Integration:</a></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                One of the services that StuList has to offer is allowing our users to define how far (in miles) they are
                willing to travel to make a transaction occur. The proximity is based off the college a student attends.
                (For example, a student at CSULB who wants to sell a book on StuList can list that he/or she is willing
                to travel in a 15 mile radius from CSULB.)
            </li>
            <li>
                Google Maps API gives us the tools to calculate the range of how far our users would be willing to travel
                to sell and buy from others on StuList.
            </li>
            <li>
                Google Maps API is a powerful tool as it gives our site navigational services for our users.
            </li>
            <li>
                It is important to note that this API implementation is one of our lowest priorities as of this moment.
                Once the main parts of our website is working properly, we will then try our best to research/implement this
                feature into our website.
            </li>
            <li>
                Furthermore, as Google Maps API integration is just a side project compared to the overall premise of creating
                StuList, we can only disclose conceptual ideas and services we’d be able to provide with Google Maps API.
            </li>
        </ul>


    <h2><a id="itemCategories">StuList Categories:</a></h2>
        <p>
            For sellers, the products required are endless. However, here in this website, we include the products that are
            in regular list of needs for the students. The search option has two categories.  The first one is a ITEMS FOR SALE/TRADE,
            which is again categorized into different sections,  under which we have a variety of products that are of very less
            price to make them affordable to students. The second one is, SERVICES OFFERED where the students are offered special services (like mentioned below) which again cost much less compared
            to outside the campus.
